Eggs are items that can be hatched to obtain Pokémon.
Eggs can be obtained in two ways: Purchasing them from [[Shops]] and trading for them from the [[Shard Traders]].
[[Breeding]] level 100 Pokémon will also insert them into the Hatchery/Queue as an Egg.
Hatching an egg will boost that Pokémon's attack by 25% of its base attack.
Where an Egg is purchased/obtained an egg has no effect on what Pokémon hatches from that egg (See Egg Pool Odds section below for more details on specific odds).
