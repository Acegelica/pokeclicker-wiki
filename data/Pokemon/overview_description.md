## Statistics

Pokémon performance is defined by some statistics based on their main games values as described here

### Base attack

The formula for a Pokemon’s Base Attack is loosely derived from Pokemon Go’s formula for CP. It can be described through the following equations:

Base offense = 2 \* [√(Atk\*SAtack) + √Spe]
Base defense = 2 \* [√(Def\*SDef) + √Spe]
Base stamina = 2 \* HP
Base attack = √(Base Defense \* Base stamina) \* (Base offense/250)
* When this value is \<10 then 10 is applied instead.
* This value is floored.
*this formula mean that all pokemon stats contribute to the pokemon attack, but not in the same amount. HP and attack values are more significant than Def or speed.*

#### Attack

When first caught, a Pokemon will at level 100 have an Attack stat equal to their Base Attack. Beneath level 100, their Attack scales linearly from 0 to their maximum Attack. However, at no point may a Pokemon’s Attack be less than 1.

The total Pokémon attack will increase as while breeding according to the attack bonus.

##### Attack Bonus

The attack bonus is the extra damage a Pokémon get in each breeding. This is **always** calculated using the base attack, not the current attack.
The **base** Attack bonus is A **25%** of their base attack.
*Example: metapod, that have a 20 base attack will have an attack bonus of 5. After 1 hatch it's total attack will be 25, after 2 hatches it will be 30 and after 10 hatches it will be 70.*

The **Attack bonus** Can be increased using 2 different @[[Vitamins]] protein and calcium:
* **Proteins** gives 1+ attack bonus. *In our example metapod will have 6 attack bonus after use 1 protein and 15 attack bonus after use 10 proteins. While Pidgeot (with 112 base attack) Will have 29 attack bonus after 1 protein and 38 after 10 proteins*
* **Calcium** gives 1% of base attack as attack bonus. *Un our example metapod will have 5,2 attack bonus after 1 calcium and 7 attack bonus after 10 calcium. While Pidgeot will have 29,12 attack bonus after 1 calcium and 39,2 after 10 calcium*
