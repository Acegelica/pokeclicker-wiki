*Note: The minimum harvest amount for any berry is 1. If the harvest amount is less than 1, you will still get at least 1. However, having a harvest amount of less than 1 affects how many berries you get from Rich Mulch and Passho berries. For example, with Rich Mulch and surrounded by 8 Passho berries, a Maranga will yield 16 berries, but a Liechi will only yield 8 berries.*

Some berries have special abilities, also called Auras. These auras often affect other berry growth and mutation, but others may affect other sections of the game. These auras are frequently used to help players find shiny pok√©mon or breed more efficiently. Here is a list of berry auras.
