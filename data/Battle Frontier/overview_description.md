## Details

Attack is calculated as 100% of the total attack of all obtained Pokémon - the Regional Attack debuff is ignored. Attack can be further increased through modifiers such as Gems and XAttack. Battle Points and Pokémon Dollars are awarded upon defeat; the former can be used at the Battle Frontier Shop. The higher the stage cleared, the more Battle Points are awarded.
Frontier stages that have already been cleared in previous attempts will be cleared twice as fast in subsequent attempts
